# My AI-Assisted Journey: Building the ADmyBRAND AI Suite Landing Page

Developing the ADmyBRAND AI Suite landing page was a hands-on experience, significantly boosted by the continuous assistance of an AI, specifically **Gemini 2.5 Flash**. My choice for this model was primarily its **speed and efficiency**. When you're in the thick of coding, getting quick, accurate responses is crucial, and Gemini 2.5 Flash delivered on that, making our back-and-forth incredibly smooth.

My process often involved a form of "prompt engineering" â€“ not just asking for code, but guiding the AI with context and specific needs. For instance, when starting out, I'd prompt for the basic Next.js and Tailwind CSS setup, then move to defining specific UI components like the `FeatureCard` or `ContactForm`, always specifying the desired libraries like Shadcn UI. This allowed the AI to generate tailored code snippets that I could then integrate directly.

Debugging was where the AI truly shone as a collaborative partner. When I hit roadblocks, like the "ContactForm defined multiple times" error or the tricky `next/image` issue where blog post images weren't showing, I'd paste the exact error messages and describe the context. The AI would then analyze the problem, suggest specific lines to check, or, as in the case of the `next.config.ts` file, correctly identify that `plus.unsplash.com` needed to be whitelisted. This iterative process of providing error output and receiving targeted solutions was incredibly efficient.

Even during the deployment phase to Vercel, when a TypeScript error related to `aos` types popped up, the AI quickly pointed me to install `@types/aos`. It felt like having an expert pair programmer constantly available to catch issues and suggest fixes.

In essence, I used Gemini 2.5 Flash as a powerful extension of my own capabilities. It handled the heavy lifting of boilerplate, remembered complex configurations, and acted as a tireless debugger, allowing me to focus more on the overall design and integration, making the entire development process faster and far less frustrating.
